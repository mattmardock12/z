## Integrating Datadog APM into Your React Native Application

The integration process generally involves these steps:

1.  **Sign Up for a Datadog Account:** If you don't already have one, create a Datadog account.  Datadog offers a free trial, allowing you to explore the platform's features.

2.  **Install the Datadog React Native SDK:** Use npm or yarn to install the `@datadog/mobile-react-native` package:

    ```bash
    npm install @datadog/mobile-react-native
    # or
    yarn add @datadog/mobile-react-native
    ```

3.  **Initialize the SDK:**  In your main application file (e.g., `App.js` or `index.js`), initialize the Datadog SDK with your Datadog application ID, client token, and environment:

    ```javascript
    import { DatadogProvider } from '@datadog/mobile-react-native';

    const datadogConfig = {
        clientToken: 'YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN', // Replace with your Datadog client token
        applicationId: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID', // Replace with your Datadog application ID
        env: 'production', // Set your environment (e.g., 'production', 'staging', 'development')
        service: 'my-react-native-app',
        version: '1.0.0',
        site: 'datadoghq.com', // or datadoghq.eu, etc.
        trackUserInteractions: true,
        trackResources: true,
        trackLongTasks: true,
    };

    const App = () => {
        return (
            <DatadogProvider config={datadogConfig}>
                {/* Your app content */}
            </DatadogProvider>
        );
    };

    export default App;
    ```

    **Important:** Replace `"YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN"` and `"YOUR_APPLICATION_ID"` with your actual Datadog credentials.  You can find these in your Datadog account settings.

4.  **Wrap Your App with `<DatadogProvider>`:** Ensure that your entire application is wrapped within the `<DatadogProvider>` component.  This component initializes the SDK and ensures that Datadog can capture data from your application.

5.  **(Optional) Configure Additional Settings:** The `datadogConfig` object allows you to customize various settings, such as the environment, service name, version, and sampling rate.  Refer to the Datadog documentation for a complete list of available options.

## Understanding RUM (Real User Monitoring) in React Native

RUM provides insights into the actual user experience of your React Native application. Datadog RUM automatically tracks key user interactions, such as:

*   **Page Views:** Tracks when users navigate to different screens or views within your application.
*   **User Actions:** Captures user interactions like button clicks, form submissions, and scroll events.
*   **Resource Loading:** Monitors the performance of resources loaded by your application, such as images, stylesheets, and scripts.
*   **Errors:**  Captures JavaScript errors and network request failures that occur in the user's browser.
*   **Session Replay:** Some RUM tools offer session replay, allowing you to visually replay user sessions to understand exactly how users are interacting with your application and identify potential usability issues.

**Benefits of RUM:**

*   **Identify User-Impacting Issues:**  RUM helps you prioritize issues that are affecting the largest number of users.
*   **Understand User Behavior:**  RUM provides insights into how users are navigating your application and which features they are using.
*   **Optimize User Flows:**  RUM helps you identify areas where users are encountering friction or dropping off.

## Custom Instrumentation

While Datadog's automatic instrumentation covers many common use cases, you may need to add custom instrumentation to track specific events or metrics that are relevant to your application. Datadog provides APIs for manually tracking:

*   **Custom Events:** Track specific events that occur within your application, such as a user completing a purchase or submitting a form.

    ```javascript
    import { datadogRum } from '@datadog/mobile-react-native';

    const handlePurchase = () => {
        // ... your purchase logic ...
        datadogRum.addUserAction('Purchase Completed', {
            item_id: '123',
            price: 9.99,
        });
    };
    ```

*   **Custom Metrics:** Track numerical values that are important to your application, such as the number of active users or the average transaction size.  You can use Datadog's metric API to send custom metrics to Datadog.
