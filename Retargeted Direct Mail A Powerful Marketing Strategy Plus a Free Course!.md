## What is Retargeted Direct Mail?

Retargeted direct mail is a marketing strategy that involves sending physical mail pieces to individuals who have previously interacted with your brand online. Think of it as a second chance to connect with potential customers who have shown interest in your products or services.

Unlike traditional direct mail, which often relies on broad demographic targeting, retargeted direct mail leverages online behavior data to identify and reach a more qualified audience. This allows for highly personalized messaging and offers that are relevant to each recipient's specific interests.

## How Does Retargeted Direct Mail Work?

The process of retargeted direct mail typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Data Collection:** You collect data about your website visitors, app users, or social media followers. This data may include their browsing history, products they viewed, items they added to their cart, or content they interacted with.

2.  **Identity Resolution:** The collected data is then used to identify the physical mailing addresses of these individuals. This can be done through various identity resolution services that match online identifiers (such as email addresses or cookies) to postal addresses.

3.  **Segmentation and Personalization:** Based on the collected data, you segment your audience into different groups with similar interests or behaviors. This allows you to create personalized mail pieces that are tailored to each recipient's specific needs and preferences.

4.  **Mail Piece Creation and Delivery:** You design and print your personalized mail pieces, which may include postcards, letters, catalogs, or other promotional materials. These mail pieces are then delivered to the identified physical addresses.

5.  **Tracking and Measurement:** It's crucial to track the performance of your retargeted direct mail campaigns to measure their effectiveness. This can be done by using unique URLs, QR codes, or promo codes in your mail pieces that allow you to track conversions and attribute them to the direct mail campaign.

## Benefits of Retargeted Direct Mail

Retargeted direct mail offers a number of advantages over traditional marketing channels, including:

*   **Increased Engagement:** Physical mail pieces tend to stand out more than digital ads, which can be easily ignored or blocked. The tactile nature of direct mail can create a more memorable and engaging experience for recipients.

*   **Improved Conversion Rates:** By targeting individuals who have already shown interest in your brand, you're more likely to generate leads and drive sales. Personalized messaging and offers can further increase conversion rates.

*   **Enhanced Brand Awareness:** Retargeted direct mail can help reinforce your brand message and build brand awareness among your target audience.

*   **Better Targeting:** Retargeting allows for highly targeted campaigns based on specific online behaviors, leading to more relevant and effective messaging.

*   **Measurable Results:** As mentioned earlier, retargeted direct mail campaigns can be tracked and measured to determine their return on investment (ROI).

## Who Can Benefit from Retargeted Direct Mail?

A wide range of businesses can benefit from retargeted direct mail, including:

*   **E-commerce Businesses:** Recover abandoned carts, promote special offers, or drive repeat purchases.

*   **Retail Businesses:** Drive traffic to brick-and-mortar stores, announce new product launches, or promote seasonal sales.
