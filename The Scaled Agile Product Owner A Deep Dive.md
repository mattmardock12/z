## Understanding the Role

In SAFe, the Product Owner (PO) remains a central figure, but their responsibilities expand and evolve. They continue to manage the Team Backlog, defining and prioritizing user stories to maximize value for the team and stakeholders. However, in a scaled environment, the PO works within a larger context, often collaborating with other POs and stakeholders across multiple teams.

The Scaled Agile Product Owner is part of an Agile Release Train (ART), a self-organizing team of Agile teams that plans, commits, and executes together. Within the ART, the PO collaborates closely with the Product Manager, who focuses on the strategic vision and roadmap for the product. The PO then translates this vision into actionable user stories and features for their team.

## Key Responsibilities of a Scaled Agile Product Owner

The Scaled Agile Product Owner has a multifaceted role that requires a blend of technical understanding, business acumen, and strong communication skills. Their primary responsibilities include:

*   **Backlog Management:** Defining, refining, and prioritizing the Team Backlog based on the Program Increment (PI) objectives and the overall product vision. This involves breaking down features into user stories, estimating their effort, and ensuring they are aligned with the ART's goals.
*   **Iteration Planning:** Participating in Iteration Planning meetings to collaborate with the development team and other stakeholders to define the iteration goals, commit to stories, and ensure a clear understanding of the requirements.
