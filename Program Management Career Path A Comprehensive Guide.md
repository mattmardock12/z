## What is Program Management?

Before diving into the career path, let's clarify what program management actually entails.

*   **Benefits Realization:** Ensuring that the program delivers the expected benefits and ROI.

Several factors make program management an attractive career choice:

*   **High Demand:** Organizations across industries need skilled program managers to drive strategic initiatives and achieve business objectives.
