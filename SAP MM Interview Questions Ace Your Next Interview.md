## General SAP MM Questions

These questions gauge your overall understanding of the SAP MM module and its functionalities.

1.  **What is SAP MM and why is it important?**

    *   SAP MM (Materials Management) is a crucial module in SAP that manages the procurement process and inventory management within an organization. It encompasses all activities related to the acquisition of goods and services, from purchase requisition to goods receipt and invoice verification.
    *   Importance: Streamlines procurement, optimizes inventory levels, reduces costs, improves efficiency, and ensures timely availability of materials.  It integrates with other SAP modules like SD (Sales and Distribution), PP (Production Planning), and FI/CO (Finance and Controlling).

2.  **What are the key processes in SAP MM?**

    *   Purchase Requisition
    *   Purchase Order
    *   Goods Receipt
    *   Invoice Verification
    *   Inventory Management

3.  **Explain the integration of SAP MM with other SAP modules.**

    *   **SAP SD:** MM interacts with SD for sales order processing.  For instance, when a sales order is created, the system checks material availability in MM.  Delivery information is then passed back to SD.
    *   **SAP PP:**  MM is integrated with PP for material requirements planning.  PP determines the required materials for production, and MM handles the procurement of those materials.
    *   **SAP FI/CO:**  Goods receipts, invoice verifications, and inventory movements impact financial accounting and controlling.  MM posts relevant data to FI/CO for general ledger accounting, cost accounting, and profitability analysis.

4.  **What are the different types of purchase orders in SAP MM?**

    *   **Standard PO:** The most common type used for procuring goods.
    *   **Framework Order (Contract/Scheduling Agreement):** Used for long-term agreements with vendors.
    *   **Blanket PO:**  Used for small-value purchases where specific details are not known upfront.
    *   **Consignment PO:** Vendor provides materials to the company, and the company only pays for the materials consumed.
    *   **Subcontracting PO:**  Materials are sent to a vendor for processing, and the vendor returns the finished product.
    *   **Stock Transport Order (STO):** Used to transfer materials between plants within the same company code.

5.  **What is a material master record and what information does it contain?**

    *   A material master record is a central repository of information about a specific material. It contains data relevant to various departments, such as purchasing, inventory management, accounting, and sales.
    *   Key information: Material description, material group, base unit of measure, purchasing data, accounting data, MRP data, storage data, and sales data.

6.  **What are the different views in a material master record? Why are they important?**

    *   Examples of Views: Basic Data, Purchasing, MRP, Accounting, Storage, Sales.
    *   Importance: Views allow different departments to maintain only the data relevant to their functions, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.  This modular approach prevents redundancy and facilitates efficient data management.

## Procurement Process Questions

These questions assess your knowledge of the procurement lifecycle.
