*   **Stakeholder Management:** Building and maintaining strong relationships with stakeholders is crucial for project success. Books offer strategies for effective communication, conflict resolution, and managing expectations.
*   **Testing and Validation:** Ensuring that the delivered solution meets the defined requirements is a critical responsibility of the business analyst. Books often discuss testing methodologies, test case creation, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
