## What are Shaman Crystals?

The term "shaman crystal" doesn't refer to a specific type of crystal, but rather to crystals used within shamanic practices. Their selection and application are rooted in the shaman's understanding of the interconnectedness of all things and the belief that crystals possess unique vibrational frequencies that can interact with the human energy field.

Shamans use crystals for a variety of purposes, including:

*   **Divination:**  Gaining insights into the past, present, and future.
*   **Healing:**  Balancing and harmonizing the physical, emotional, and spiritual bodies.
*   **Protection:**  Creating energetic shields against negative influences.
*   **Journeying:**  Facilitating altered states of consciousness for exploration of the spirit world.
*   **Ceremony:**  Enhancing the power and effectiveness of rituals and ceremonies.
*   **Connection with Ancestors:**  Acting as focal points for communication with ancestral spirits.

The specific crystals chosen will vary depending on the shaman's tradition, the intended purpose, and the individual needs of the person seeking assistance. However, some crystals are commonly used across different shamanic cultures.
