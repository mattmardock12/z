## Why Use Let's Encrypt with MikroTik RouterOS 7?

Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA) provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG). It simplifies the process of obtaining and installing SSL/TLS certificates, which are essential for enabling HTTPS.

Here's why you should use Let's Encrypt on your MikroTik RouterOS 7:

*   **Enhanced Security:** HTTPS encrypts the communication between your browser and your router, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This is particularly important when accessing the router's web interface or API.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Most modern browsers display warnings when accessing websites or services over HTTP. By using HTTPS, you eliminate these warnings and provide a more professional and trustworthy experience.
*   **Free and Automated:** Let's Encrypt certificates are free, and the process of obtaining and renewing them can be automated using scripts. This eliminates the need for manual certificate management, saving you time and effort.
*   **Trustworthy:** Let's Encrypt certificates are trusted by all major web browsers, ensuring that your users will not encounter any security warnings.
*   **Required for Modern Security Practices:** Many newer features and technologies rely on HTTPS. Securing your MikroTik with Let's Encrypt is an important step toward staying current.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*   **A MikroTik Router running RouterOS 7:** This guide is specifically designed for RouterOS 7. While some steps might be similar on older versions, they might not be exactly the same.
*   **A Publicly Accessible Domain Name:** You'll need a domain name that points to the public IP address of your MikroTik router. This is necessary for Let's Encrypt to verify that you own the domain.
*   **Port 80 and 443 Forwarding:** Ensure that ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) are forwarded to your MikroTik router's internal IP address. This allows Let's Encrypt to perform domain verification.
*   **Basic Understanding of MikroTik RouterOS:** Familiarity with the MikroTik RouterOS interface and command-line interface (CLI) will be helpful.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Let's Encrypt

This guide uses a script-based approach for automating the Let's Encrypt certificate generation and renewal process.

**Step 1: Create a Script for Let's Encrypt**

Log into your MikroTik router using Winbox or the CLI. Create a new script with the following content:

```routeros
/system script
add name=letsencrypt policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive source="
# Script for Let's Encrypt certificate generation and renewal

:local domain \"yourdomain.com\"  # Replace with your domain name
:local interface \"ether1\"      # Replace with your public interface
:local email \"youremail@example.com\" # Replace with your email address

# Get current date
:local nowdate [/system clock get date]
:local nowtime [/system clock get time]

# Define Let's Encrypt directory
:local letsencryptdir \"/disk1/letsencrypt\"

# Create Let's Encrypt directory if it doesn't exist
/file print file=\$letsencryptdir
:if ([:len [/file get \$letsencryptdir contents]] = 0) do={
    /file create name=\$letsencryptdir type=directory
}

# Create script for certificate generation
:local script \"
:log info \\\"Starting Let's Encrypt script\\\";
/tool fetch url=\\\"https://get.acme.sh\\\" check-certificate=no as-value=dst
/file move \$dst to=\\\"\$letsencryptdir/acme.sh\\\"
/system scheduler add name=removeme start-time=\$nowtime interval=1m disabled=no on-event=\\\"/file remove \\\\\\\"\\\$letsencryptdir/acme.sh\\\\\\\"\\\"
:delay 10
/file remove removeme
/file remove \$letsencryptdir/acme.sh
:log info \\\"Downloaded acme.sh script\\\";

# Install acme.sh and issue certificate
/system script
add name=letsencrypt_issue policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive source=\\\"
/file print file=\\\\\\\"\$letsencryptdir/acme.sh\\\\\\\"
/tool fetch url=\\\\\\\"https://get.acme.sh\\\\\\\" check-certificate=no as-value=dst
/file move \$dst to=\\\\\\\"\$letsencryptdir/acme.sh\\\\\\\"

:log info \\\\\\\"Installing acme.sh and issuing certificate\\\\\\\";

/tool fetch url=\\\\\\\"https://get.acme.sh\\\\\\\" check-certificate=no as-value=dst
/file move \$dst to=\\\\\\\"\$letsencryptdir/acme.sh\\\\\\\"

:delay 5
/system script
add name=installacmepolicy policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive source=\\\\\\\"

    #install acme.sh

    tool fetch url=\\\\\\\"https://get.acme.sh\\\\\\\" check-certificate=no as-value=dst

    file move \$dst to=\\\\\\\"\$letsencryptdir/acme.sh\\\\\\\"
    cd \$letsencryptdir

    log info  \\\\\\\" Running acme.sh

    ./acme.sh --install -m \\\\\\\"\$email\\\\\\\"  || { log warning \\\\\\\" acme.sh install failed\\\\\\\"; return;}

    ./acme.sh --issue --dns dns_cf  -d \\\\\\\"\$domain\\\\\\\"  || { log warning \\\\\\\" acme.sh issue failed\\\\\\\"; return;}
    ./acme.sh --installcert  -d \\\\\\\"\$domain\\\\\\\" --fullchainpath /cert.pem --keypath /key.pem

    #import certificate

    :delay 5
    /certificate import file-name=/cert.pem passphrase=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"

    :delay 5
    /certificate import file-name=/key.pem passphrase=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"

   #set certificate

    /system identity set name=\\\\\\\"\$domain\\\\\\\"
\\\\\\\"

\\\"

/system script run installacmepolicy
\\\"

/system script run letsencrypt_issue

/certificate set [find where name=\$domain] trusted=yes
/ip service set www certificate=\$domain disabled=no

/system script remove installacmepolicy
/system script remove letsencrypt_issue
"
```

**Important:**

*   Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.
*   Replace `ether1` with the name of the interface that has your public IP address.
*   Replace `youremail@example.com` with your actual email address.

**Step 2: Run the Script**

Execute the script you created:

```routeros
/system script run letsencrypt
```

This script will:

1.  Download the `acme.sh` script, which is used to interact with Let's Encrypt.
2.  Install `acme.sh`.
3.  Issue a Let's Encrypt certificate for your domain.
4.  Import the certificate and key into the MikroTik certificate store.
5.  Set the certificate for the web server service (WWW).
6.  Trust the certificate.

**Step 3: Verify the Certificate**

After the script completes successfully, verify that the certificate is correctly installed:

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `https://yourdomain.com`.
2.  Check the certificate details in your browser to ensure that it's a valid Let's Encrypt certificate for your domain.

**Step 4: Automate Certificate Renewal**

Let's Encrypt certificates are only valid for 90 days. To automate the renewal process, create a scheduled task that runs the script periodically:

```routeros
/system scheduler
add name=letsencrypt_renew interval=1d start-time=00:00:00 on-event=/system/script/run letsencrypt policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive
```

This will run the `letsencrypt` script every day at midnight, ensuring that your certificate is always up-to-date.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Domain Verification Failed:** This usually indicates that Let's Encrypt cannot access your domain on ports 80 or 443. Double-check your port forwarding rules and ensure that your domain name resolves to your router's public IP address.
*   **Script Errors:** Carefully review the script for any typos or errors. Check the MikroTik logs for more detailed error messages.
*   **Certificate Not Trusted:** This might indicate that the certificate chain is not properly configured. Ensure that the Let's Encrypt root certificate is trusted by your browser.
