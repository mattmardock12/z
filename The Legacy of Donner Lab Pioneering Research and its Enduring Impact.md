## A Visionary Beginning: From Radiation to Medicine

The story of Donner Lab begins with Ernest O. Lawrence, the Nobel laureate and inventor of the cyclotron. Lawrence recognized the potential of using radioactive isotopes, produced by his cyclotron, for medical diagnosis and treatment. This vision led to the establishment of the Donner Laboratory, named after William Henry Donner, a philanthropist who provided crucial funding for its construction.

Initially, the lab focused on understanding the biological effects of radiation. Researchers investigated how radiation interacted with living tissues, aiming to develop safe and effective protocols for radiation therapy. This early work laid the foundation for the development of radiation oncology as a distinct medical specialty.

## Pioneering Nuclear Medicine Techniques

Donner Lab played a pivotal role in the development of nuclear medicine techniques. Scientists at the lab pioneered the use of radioactive isotopes to image internal organs and diagnose diseases. They developed methods for producing and administering radiopharmaceuticals, substances containing radioactive isotopes that are selectively absorbed by specific tissues or organs.

One of the most significant achievements was the development of the first positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. This revolutionary technology allowed doctors to visualize metabolic processes in the body, providing unprecedented insights into disease mechanisms. Early PET scans were used to study brain function, diagnose heart disease, and detect cancer.

## Beyond Medical Applications: Biophysics and Space Exploration

The research at Donner Lab extended beyond nuclear medicine. The lab also housed a thriving biophysics program, where scientists investigated the physical properties of biological molecules and systems. These studies contributed to our understanding of fundamental biological processes, such as DNA replication and protein folding.

Furthermore, Donner Lab played a significant role in the early days of space exploration. Researchers studied the effects of cosmic radiation on astronauts and developed countermeasures to protect them from harmful radiation exposure. Their work was crucial for ensuring the safety of early space missions.

## Key Figures and Lasting Contributions

Many prominent scientists contributed to the success of Donner Lab. John H. Lawrence, Ernest Lawrence's brother, served as the lab's director for many years and was a pioneer in the field of hematology. He developed the first successful treatment for polycythemia vera, a blood disorder characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells, using radioactive phosphorus.

Cornelius Tobias was another key figure, known for his work on heavy ion radiation therapy. He developed methods for using beams of heavy ions, such as carbon ions, to target and destroy cancerous tumors with greater precision than conventional radiation therapy.

Hardin Jones, a biophysicist at Donner Lab, made significant contributions to our understanding of aging. His work on mortality rates and the Gompertz law helped to establish the field of gerontology.

The contributions of Donner Lab are far-reaching and have had a profound impact on medicine and science. The lab's pioneering work in nuclear medicine, biophysics, and space exploration has led to the development of new diagnostic tools, treatments, and technologies that have improved the lives of countless people.

## The End of an Era, The Beginning of a Legacy

Despite its immense contributions, the original Donner Lab building faced closure and demolition in recent years due to seismic safety concerns. The building, constructed in the 1940s, was deemed structurally unsound and posed a risk to occupants. However, the legacy of Donner Lab lives on through the scientists it trained, the technologies it developed, and the research it inspired.

The spirit of innovation that characterized Donner Lab continues to drive research at UC Berkeley and other institutions around the world. Scientists are building upon the foundations laid by Donner Lab researchers, pushing the boundaries of knowledge in areas such as medical imaging, radiation therapy, and biophysics.

## Looking Ahead: The Future of Medical Physics and Biophysics

The fields of medical physics and biophysics are constantly evolving, driven by technological advances and a growing understanding of the human body. New imaging techniques, such as molecular imaging and multi-modal imaging, are providing increasingly detailed views of disease processes. Advanced radiation therapy techniques, such as proton therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery, are allowing doctors to target tumors with greater precision and minimize damage to healthy tissues.

Biophysics is playing an increasingly important role in drug discovery and development. Scientists are using biophysical techniques to study the structure and function of proteins, identify potential drug targets, and design new therapies.
