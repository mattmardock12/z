## What is a Cybersecurity Mentor?

A cybersecurity mentor is an experienced professional who provides guidance, advice, and support to individuals seeking to learn about or advance in the field of cybersecurity.

This mentorship extends beyond technical skills; it encompasses professional development, ethical considerations, and the ability to adapt to the ever-changing threat landscape.

## Why Do You Need a Cybersecurity Mentor?

The field of cybersecurity is vast and complex. It's constantly evolving, with new threats and technologies emerging every day. Trying to navigate this landscape on your own can be overwhelming. A cybersecurity mentor can provide:
