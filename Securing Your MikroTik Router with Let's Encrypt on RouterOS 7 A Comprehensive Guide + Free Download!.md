## Why Use Let's Encrypt on Your MikroTik Router?

Before diving into the configuration, let's understand the benefits:

*   **Secure Web Interface (HTTPS):**  By default, MikroTik routers use HTTP for the web interface (Winbox), which transmits data in plain text.  Using HTTPS encrypts this traffic, protecting your login credentials and configuration data from eavesdropping.
*   **Improved Security Posture:**  A valid SSL/TLS certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt enhances your overall security posture.  It helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures the integrity of your communication.
*   **Free and Automated:** Let's Encrypt is completely free, eliminating the cost associated with purchasing SSL certificates from commercial CAs.  Furthermore, the process of obtaining and renewing certificates can be automated, simplifying administration.
*   **Trusted by Browsers:**  Let's Encrypt certificates are widely recognized and trusted by all major web browsers, preventing those annoying "Your connection is not private" warnings.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you meet the following requirements:

*   **A MikroTik Router Running RouterOS 7:** This guide is specifically for RouterOS 7.  The configuration steps might differ on older versions.
*   **Publicly Accessible Domain Name:** You'll need a domain name (e.g., `myrouter.example.com`) that resolves to the public IP address of your MikroTik router. This is crucial for Let's Encrypt to verify your ownership of the domain.
*   **Port 80 Forwarding:** Let's Encrypt uses the HTTP-01 challenge for domain validation, which requires your router to be accessible on port 80 from the internet.  You'll need to configure port forwarding on your router's firewall to forward incoming traffic on port 80 to the router itself.  **Important Security Note:** After obtaining the certificate, it's highly recommended to disable or restrict this port forwarding rule to minimize potential security risks.
*   **Basic RouterOS Knowledge:** Familiarity with the RouterOS command-line interface (CLI) or Winbox is essential.

## Step-by-Step Configuration

Here's a detailed guide on configuring Let's Encrypt on your MikroTik router:

**1.  Create a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) Entry (If Applicable)**

If you have a dynamic public IP address (which changes periodically), you'll need to use a DDNS service to keep your domain name pointing to your current IP. Many DDNS providers offer free services. MikroTik routers also support DDNS clients built-in. Configure your router to update your DDNS entry whenever your IP address changes.

**2. Configure Port 80 Forwarding**

This step is critical for Let's Encrypt to verify your domain. Use Winbox or the CLI to create a firewall rule to forward traffic on port 80 to your router's internal IP address.

*   **Using Winbox:**
    *   Go to IP -> Firewall -> NAT.
    *   Click the "+" button to add a new rule.
    *   On the "General" tab:
        *   Chain: `dstnat`
        *   Dst. Port: `80`
        *   Protocol: `tcp`
        *   In. Interface: The interface connected to the internet (e.g., `ether1`)
    *   On the "Action" tab:
        *   Action: `dst-nat`
        *   To Addresses: The router's internal IP address (e.g., `192.168.88.1`)
        *   To Ports: `80`
    *   Click "Apply" and "OK."

*   **Using CLI:**

    ```routeros
    /ip firewall nat
    add chain=dstnat dst-port=80 in-interface=ether1 protocol=tcp action=dst-nat to-addresses=192.168.88.1 to-ports=80 comment="Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 Challenge"
    ```

**Important:**  Remember to disable or restrict this rule after obtaining the certificate.  Consider only allowing traffic from Let's Encrypt's IP ranges for increased security.

**3. Obtain the Let's Encrypt Certificate**

RouterOS 7 includes built-in support for Let's Encrypt, simplifying the certificate acquisition process.  You'll use the `/certificate` command in the CLI.

```routeros
/certificate
add name=letsencrypt-cert common-name=myrouter.example.com acme=yes acme-dns=no acme-caa=no
:delay 5
/certificate/print detail where name=letsencrypt-cert
```

Let's break down this command:

*   `add name=letsencrypt-cert`: Creates a new certificate object named "letsencrypt-cert."  You can choose any name you like.
*   `common-name=myrouter.example.com`: Specifies the domain name for which the certificate will be issued.  Replace `myrouter.example.com` with your actual domain name.
*   `acme=yes`: Enables the ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) protocol, which is used by Let's Encrypt.
*   `acme-dns=no acme-caa=no`:  Disable DNS based validation and CAA validation.

After running this command, the router will attempt to obtain the certificate from Let's Encrypt. This process involves the HTTP-01 challenge, where Let's Encrypt tries to access a specific file on your router's web server to verify your domain ownership.  This is why port 80 forwarding is necessary.

Use the `:delay 5` command to give the router some time to initialize the certificate request. Then, use the `/certificate/print detail where name=letsencrypt-cert` command to check the status of the certificate. Look for the `status` field.  It should eventually say "valid."  If it shows an error message, review your configuration and ensure your domain name resolves to your router's public IP address and that port 80 forwarding is correctly configured.

**4. Configure the Web Interface to Use the New Certificate**

Once the certificate is successfully obtained, you need to configure the router's web interface to use it.

*   **Using Winbox:**
    *   Go to IP -> Services.
    *   Double-click on "www-ssl."
    *   In the "Certificate" dropdown, select the newly created "letsencrypt-cert."
    *   Click "Apply" and "OK."
    *   Disable or change the port of the regular "www" service (HTTP) for security.

*   **Using CLI:**

    ```routeros
    /ip service
    set www-ssl certificate=letsencrypt-cert disabled=no
    set www disabled=yes
    ```

**5. Test the HTTPS Connection**

Open a web browser and navigate to `https://myrouter.example.com`. You should see the MikroTik RouterOS web interface, and your browser should indicate that the connection is secure (usually with a padlock icon).  If you see a security warning, double-check that you selected the correct certificate in the IP -> Services settings.

**6. Automate Certificate Renewal**

Let's Encrypt certificates are only valid for 90 days.  You'll need to automate the renewal process to prevent your certificate from expiring.  RouterOS 7 makes this easy with a built-in scheduler.

*   **Using Winbox:**
    *   Go to System -> Scheduler.
    *   Click the "+" button to add a new scheduled task.
    *   Name: `letsencrypt-renewal` (or any name you prefer).
    *   Start Time: Adjust to your preference (e.g., `1h` for one hour from now).
    *   Interval: `1d` (run daily).
    *   On Event:

        ```routeros
        /certificate renew letsencrypt-cert
        ```

    *   Click "Apply" and "OK."

*   **Using CLI:**

    ```routeros
    /system scheduler
    add name=letsencrypt-renewal start-time=1h interval=1d on-event="/certificate renew letsencrypt-cert" policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive
    ```

This scheduled task will attempt to renew the certificate daily. If the certificate is close to expiring (within 30 days), it will be automatically renewed.

**7. Secure Your Router Further**

While using Let's Encrypt is a significant security improvement, it's essential to implement other security best practices:

*   **Change the Default Administrator Password:** This is a fundamental security measure.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:**  Disable any services you don't need, such as Telnet or FTP.
*   **Limit Access to the Web Interface:** Restrict access to the web interface by IP address. Only allow access from trusted networks.
*   **Keep Your RouterOS Updated:**  Regularly update your RouterOS to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Implement a Strong Firewall:**  Configure a robust firewall to protect your network from unauthorized access.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

*   **"Could not resolve hostname" error:**  Ensure your domain name is correctly configured and resolves to your router's public IP address.  Verify your DDNS setup if you have a dynamic IP.
*   **"Challenge failed" error:**  Double-check your port 80 forwarding configuration. Make sure Let's Encrypt can access your router on port 80.  Temporary disable any other services that might be using port 80 (e.g., another web server).
*   **"Certificate not trusted" error:**  Make sure you've correctly configured the web interface to use the Let's Encrypt certificate. Clear your browser's cache and try again.
*   **Renewal fails:**  Verify that the scheduler is running correctly and that the `/certificate renew` command is executed successfully.  Check your router's logs for any error messages. Ensure the port 80 forwarding is still in place, or alternative DNS challenge is set up if you no longer want to keep port 80 open.
