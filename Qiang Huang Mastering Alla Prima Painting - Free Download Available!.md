## The Allure of Alla Prima: Painting Wet-on-Wet

*   **Spontaneity:** The wet-on-wet nature of the technique allows for a fluid and dynamic process. Colors blend and merge seamlessly, creating a sense of movement and energy.
*   **Luminosity:** Alla prima paintings often possess a characteristic luminosity due to the blending of wet paint, which creates subtle gradations of tone and color.
